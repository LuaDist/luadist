* About LuaDist
  -------------
  LuaDist is a CMake-based multi-platform standalone Lua distribution
  providing a build environment and module management. For more information
  please visit http://www.luadist.org.

* Availability
  ------------
  LuaDist is freely available for both academic and commercial purposes under
  MIT license. See COPYRIGHT for details. Please see individual packages for
  their license.

* Installation
  ------------
  LuaDist relies on CMake (www.cmake.org) for building. The build process
  consists of two stages. First stage in the CMake based bootstrap that will
  build and install all needed Lua components. Second stage uses the LuaDist
  install from bootstrap to build the final release. This process is needed to
  ensure LuaDist remains self updateable and endorses its correct deployment
  structure.

  To build LuaDist on Unix (including Linux, OS X and Cygwin) systems simply
  use the provided build bash script.

	> ./build [optional CMake arguments]
	
  LuaDist can be built natively on Windows using MinGW and MSVC compilers
  (possibly others). For this purpose we provide respective build.bat and
  build_msvc.bat scripts which you can use.

* Running
  -------
  To use LuaDist a few environment variables need to be set up. For this purpose
  a "dist" or "dist.bat" script is generated in deployment directories by
  default. Running the script will set up all needed environment variables after
  which you can use the provided packages. Alternatively you can add the variables
  to your profile manually on startup to avoid using the script entirely.

  To invoke the luadist CLI simply use:
	$ ./dist
	LuaDist-1.0.0$ luadist

  Commands can also be run directly using:
	$ ./dist lua

* Compatibility
  -------------
  LuaDist was designed to support Unix/Linux, Mac and Windows
  installs. Windows and Cygwin support is limited by the lack of support for
  symlinks. On these systems files are copied directly into the deployment 
  directory instead and are therefore not available inside "dists" subdirectory.

  We are testing on the following operating systems:
	Ubuntu 10.04, amd64 and x86
	OS X 10.6, intel
	Windows 7 with MinGW compiler, 32bit
	Windows 7 with MSVC compilers, 32bit
	Cygwin on Windows 7, 32bit
